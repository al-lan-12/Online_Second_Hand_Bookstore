# Online_Second_Hand_Bookstore
This website allows you to sell and buy secondhand books online through our website. Each user will create his/her account on the website through which they can sell or buy books from other users. This project basically focuses on our college where the seniors can sell their books to the juniors. Apart from books ,they can also sell important tools such as drafters and other mechanical tools required for college purpose. There will be a fixed price for every book.  For eg if a book originally costs 1000 rs ,then the seller will sell the book at a price of 600 or 650 rs.through this way, there will be an easy way to sell the used books and also the juniors can buy the books at a very low cost.  As we keep working and studying in our college, we often need reference books for the subjects we study in order to get notes. These notes or books are often very highly priced and it is much cheaper to by the books online. But getting the book is difficult and contacting the person having the book is difficult too. Hence making a online forum to help sell and buy second hand books will be helpful
